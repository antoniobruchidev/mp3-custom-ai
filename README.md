# Custom AI

## Concept
The idea is to let each user create and share if they want, their own AI assistant, each with different personalities and trait affecting their characters.
To be able to do this I'll have to work with "abliterated" models (more later), so we'll make sure users won't incur in using one public but "unsafe" model capable of talking about difficult topics, we will label them as NSFW.

## V1 Features
 - Fully customizable AI chatbot/assistant 

## Future Features
